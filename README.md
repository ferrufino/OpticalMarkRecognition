# OpticalMarkRecognition

Obtained source code for OMR from http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~aseth/udai/OMRProj/README.html 

The tool has been written by Aaditeshwar Seth from the Udai Waterloo chapter, at the University of Waterloo.



Seemed really outdated and with bugs. 

Fixed source code and made it run with @ecristerna. 

Then adapted for the use of a social food storage in Monterrey, Mexico.
